#Sorting Algorithms in Go

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in Go programming language.
Algorithms Implemented
1. Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

Implementation:

   File: insertion_sort.go
    Usage:

    go run insertion_sort.go

2. Selection Sort

Selection sort sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

Implementation:

  File: selection_sort.go
    Usage:

    go run selection_sort.go

3. Bubble Sort

Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Implementation:

  File: bubble_sort.go
    Usage:

    go run bubble_sort.go

4. Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

Implementation:

  File: merge_sort.go
    Usage:

    go run merge_sort.go

5. Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that picks an element as pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.

Implementation:

  File: quick_sort.go
    Usage:

    go run quick_sort.go

Running the Examples

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate Go file. To run an example, navigate to the directory containing the file and use the go run command as shown in each section above.
